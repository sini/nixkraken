# Module options

All Nixkraken options are available under the `programs.nixkraken` attribute.

This chapter provides a complete reference for every available option. For practical, real-world examples, refer to the [configuration examples](../getting-started/examples.md).

## Option groups

Options are organized into logical groups exposed as children attributes to `programs.nixkraken` (ie. the `commitGraph` options are available at `programs.nixkraken.commitGraph`).

Choose a group in the navigation menu to see its available settings.

## Root options list

These options are available directly under `programs.nixkraken`.
