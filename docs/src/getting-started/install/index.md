# Installation

Although the recommended method to install NixKraken is through [Flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes), we also fully support installing it on channel-based setups.

Additionally, NixKraken is compatible both with standalone Home Manager configurations and NixOS integrated ones.

Please refer to the installation guides below to learn how to install NixKraken and its complementary packages.
