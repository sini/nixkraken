# Introduction

**Nixkraken** provides a [Home Manager](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager) module for managing [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com) configuration files and profiles in a declarative and reproducible way.

> Nixkraken is only handling GitKraken's configuration, one still needs to purchase the product to benefit paid features. **This is not a cracked GitKraken app.**
