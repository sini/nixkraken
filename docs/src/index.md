# Introduction

**Nixkraken** provides a [Home Manager][home-manager] module for managing [GitKraken][gitkraken] configuration files and profiles in a declarative and reproducible way.

## Contributing

Unlike GitKraken, Nixkraken is free and open source, **contributions are welcome!** Note however that Nixkraken is only handling GitKraken's configuration, one still needs to purchase the product to benefit paid features. **This is not a cracked GitKraken app.**

The source code can be found on [GitHub][gh] and issues and feature requests can be posted on the [GitHub issue tracker][gh-issues].

To add new options, improve documentation, or fix bugs, please open a [pull request][gh-pr].
