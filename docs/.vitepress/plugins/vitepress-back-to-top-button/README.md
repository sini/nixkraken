This is a locally grabbed copy of the [vitepress-back-to-top-button](https://github.com/miletorix/vitepress-back-to-top-button) package.

The source code is unmodified. We retrieved it because we're using VitePress 2.x and the package is marked as compatible with VitePress 1.6.3+, even though it works fine with VitePress 2.

Copyright and license are the ones from upstream in this repository.

This should, at one point, go away to use the upstream package.
